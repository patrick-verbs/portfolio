###### _[Portfolio](https://github.com/patrick-verbs/portfolio) > [About](#About) > Description_
This portfolio (specifically, its landing page) was initially created as an assignment. The goal was to demonstrate proficiency in basic HTML, CSS, Markdown, and Git(Hub) workflows, with a clear communication of ideas both under the hood (i.e., code and file structure) and in its final, public-facing presentation.

### <a name="Strategy"></a>Strategy
###### _[Portfolio](https://github.com/patrick-verbs/portfolio) > [History](#History) > [Progress on Assigned Project](#Progress) > Strategy_
- [x] Establish repo & file structure
- [x] Establish and continually update README file to plan, track, execute, and showcase progress on this project
- [x] HTML code established with correct use of headers
- [x] Research portfolio styles for inspiration (i.e., web surf)
  - [ ] Icons for LinkedIn, Twitter, and GH links (prob center at bottom of page, separate solid bg color, with copyright notice for self)
  - [x] "Portfolio" in all-caps text, likely centered, h1 priority
  - [x] "Patrick Lee" in all-caps text-graphic, likely top-left, h2/h3 priority
  - [ ] Text "tabs" (really, just clickable text graphics) for various sections:
    - [ ] "Work"
      - [ ] "Programming"
        - [ ] MS Word macro for em dashes & extraneous spaces
        - [ ] All repos made for Epicodus work
        - [ ] SHA-2 file checker
        - [ ] Timeline work
        - [ ] Card game work
      - [ ] "Art"
      - [ ] "Writing"
        - [ ] "Fiction"
        - [ ] "Exposition"
        - [ ] "Editing"
    - [ ] "About Me"
    - [ ] "WIP"
    - [ ] "Contact"
    - [ ] Not something I've seen on portfolios, but a "Legal" tab (undecided on just including in "Contact" -- current preference is for separate tab)
  - [ ] ___Tabs collapse into hamburger menu at low-res??___
    - [ ] Bootstrap for breakpoints: https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/responsive-utilities/
    - [ ] Bootstrap hamburger menu, may require JS/jQuery: https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/b4/jquery/navigation/hamburger-menu/
  - [ ] Tabs link to text on same page (index.html) -- single-page design, can scroll instead to see same info
- [ ] Research portfolio design best practices
- [ ] Brain-storm/flow-chart the page layout
- [ ] Block out the layout
  - [x] Use Bootstrap to save time (...wound up not saving time)
  - [ ] Use the Block Model from scratch in at least one instance to make sure I really have a grasp on the concept ([resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp), [resource 2](https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/))
  - [x] Use the Block Model, and other CSS-from-scratch methods, in further instances if I find any preferable to Bootstrap's cookie-cutter execution
- [ ] Write all content from the project prompt outside my GitHub (e.g., use MS Word to write the “About Me” section, my list of projects with descriptions, my hobbies, etc.)
- [x] If necessary, use placeholder content while prioritizing __functional__ objectives

### <a name="Triage"></a>Triage
###### _[Portfolio](https://github.com/patrick-verbs/portfolio) > [History](#History) > [Progress on Assigned Project](#Progress) > Triage_

  - Priority 3: Fulfilling all aesthetic objectives (i.e., good design) to demonstrate reliable adherence to a client's vision
  - Priority 4: Any additional aesthetic goals beyond requirements, such as extra design elements to add personality
  - Priority 5: Any additional functional goals beyond requirements, such as incorporation of JS features
