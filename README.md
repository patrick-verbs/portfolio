## Description
##### This portfolio (specifically, its landing page) was initially created as an assignment. The goal was to demonstrate proficiency in basic HTML, CSS, Markdown, and Git(Hub) workflows, with a clear communication of ideas both under the hood (i.e., code and file structure) and in its final, public-facing presentation.

## Progress
### Strategy
- [x] Establish repo & file structure
- [x] Establish and continually update README file to plan, track, execute, and showcase progress on this project
- [x] HTML code established with correct use of headers
- [ ] Research portfolio styles for inspiration (i.e., web surf)
- [ ] Research portfolio design best practices
- [ ] Brain-storm/flow-chart the page layout
- [ ] Block out the layout
  - [ ] Use Bootstrap to save time
  - [ ] Use the Block Model from scratch in at least one instance to make sure I really have a grasp on the concept ([resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp), [resource 2](https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/))
  - [ ] Use the Block Model, and other CSS-from-scratch methods, in further instances if I find any preferable to Bootstrap's cookie-cutter execution
- [ ] Write all content from the project prompt outside my GitHub (e.g., use MS Word to write the “About Me” section, my list of projects with descriptions, my hobbies, etc.)
- [ ] If necessary, use placeholder content while achieving the below objectives
  - Priority 1: Fulfilling all functional objectives to demonstrate programming proficiency
  - Priority 2: Fulfilling all thematic objectives (i.e., complete content) to demonstrate accomplishment of goals
  - Priority 3: Fulfilling all aesthetic objectives (i.e., good design) to demonstrate reliable adherence to vision
  - Priority 4: Any additional aesthetic goals beyond requirements (e.g. additional design elements)
  - Priority 5: Any additional functional goals beyond requirements (e.g. incorporation of JS)

### Project Requirements
- [ ] Create a portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS, which will later act as the landing page for my programming portfolio
- [ ] Include:
  - [ ] my name
  - [ ] an image representing myself
  - [ ] a list of projects I have created with active links to their GitHub pages sites or GitHub repositories
    - [ ] for each, include a brief description of the project and what languages it uses
  - [ ] an “About Me” section
  - [ ] my background (education, job experience, or why I decided to take a class on programming, etc.)
  - [ ] my current interests, hobbies, and skills
  - [ ] a __gh-pages__ branch so that your site may be viewed on GitHub Pages at __patrick-verbs.github.io/portfolio__


### Underlying Objectives
- [ ] The following HTML tags are all used:
  - [ ] p
  - [ ] h
  - [ ] ul
  - [ ] ol
  - [ ] li
  - [ ] em
  - [ ] strong
  - [ ] a
  - [ ] img
  - [ ] div

- [ ] Project includes a custom-made stylesheet that uses:

  - [ ] Correct indendation throughout
  - [ ] Correct spacing throughout
  - [ ] Only necessary comments and debugging tools throughout
- [ ] The project repo contains a README that includes:
  - [x] author name
  - [x] project or program name
  - [x] description of program
  - [ ] program setup instructions
  - [x] link to site on GitHub Pages
  - [x] copyright and license information
